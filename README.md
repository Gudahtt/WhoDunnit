In this project we aim to create a video game based upon the board game “Clue”. The game shall allow anywhere between 3 and 6 players to participate in each game.


Problem Statement
===============

We are developing an electronic version of the board game “Clue” to broaden the appeal of the classic game by making it playable alone, with friends, or over a network (in future versions).  Each game shall have at least one human player, and between 2-5 additional human or computer players. The computer’s AI has three difficulty settings: easy, medium and hard.

The interface of the game shall closely resemble the board game version, featuring an identical game board, as well as the “detective notebooks” used by players to keep track of the information they have gathered so far. We seek to emulate the experience of playing the board game with friends, without the hassle of setting up an actual game board, moving player tokens, shuffling decks of cards, or rolling dice.
